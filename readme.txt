Create your own glossary of hot-linked terms, inside your own site!
This plugin is a fork from the inactive plugin "WP Glossary" by tcbarrett. The whole base plugin is from him, I just did some improvements. For any bugs, please post on my blog's [iThoughts Tooltip Glossary page](http://www.gerkindevelopment.net/en/portfolio/ithoughts-tooltip-glossary/), as I'll be able to bring corrections and improvements.

== Description ==

Build a glossary on your site, and link terms in your posts to it with tooltips.

Reasons for using ithoughts-tooltip-glossary plugin:

* External glossary sites don't have all the words and terms you need.
* You want to keep your visitors on your site (not send them to an external glossary site).
* You don't want the adverts that the external site popups come with.

[For further details visit my dedicated plugin landing page](http://www.gerkindevelopment.net/en/portfolio/ithoughts-tooltip-glossary/)

== Installation ==

Either install through admin panel (this is the eaiest way), or:

1. Upload `ithoughts-tooltip-glossary.zip` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Unzip the archive
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

If you create your own single template for glossary terms, don't forget to remove the reference filter.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin create any new tables? =

No. It uses custom post types and taxonomies.

= Can I link it to an external glossary =

Yes. As of version 1.2 you can add a reference title and link.

= None of the details pages are working! =

Please resave your rewrite rules: Settings > Permalinks > Save Changes (just click the button)

= It doesn't do anything? =

You have to add the terms (Glossary Terms > Add New Term) and then use the appropriate TinyMCE button.
